## Overview

This repository contains a large collection of _Mathematica_ notebook files written during my time as a graduate student at Illinois Institute of Technology between 2014 and 2019, although I intend to add more over time. I originally started these projects as a way to teach myself _Mathematica_ for use as a calculus teaching assistant, but eventually started making demonstrations for topics of personal interest or for use in my own classes.

Some of these projects have been uploaded to the [_Wolfram Demonstrations Project_](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/). My creator page can be found at http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/author.html?author=Adam+Rumpf.
